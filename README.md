# Basic Graphing Calculator in Python
Hello, and welcome to my Github repository! I am trying to make a graphing calculator to test my programming skills, and improve them. The project currently has two main files, one of them contains the base functions of the graphing calculator, and the other will create, manipulate and graph functions based on user input.

NOTE: I currently have to use old hardware for development, so I encounter performance issues from time to time. I am also trying to make the project as optimized as possible.
